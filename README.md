- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeilPathil
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis and studying an MSc in Financial Risk Management from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL, which will constitute most if not all the code in my repo.
- 💞️ This repo will exhibit all the projects I have worked on. When using Jupyter Notebook, I will
      often embed notes into my code as a form of self-teaching.
- 📫 My email is neil.pathil@gmail.com if you want to reach me.
